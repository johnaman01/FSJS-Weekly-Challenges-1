FSJS-Weekly-Challenges

Weekly challenges will be posted in this repo.  You can fork the repo to your own GitHub and continue to pull the latest, merge with your solutions, and commit back to your own GitHub.

9/13/2016: This is a change to the README file to see if you correctly pulled the changes.  If you did a pull request and see both this message AND your own local changes, you did it correctly!
